#Full-Stack Restaurant App

##Description
This is a mock restaurant ordering app built with NextJS, Stripe, and Strapi. A user can log in, add items from 3 different restaurants to a cart, and order with Stripe using test payment settings/information.

##How to Use
Click the "Sign Up" link to create an account, then click on the restaurant buttons to view available dishes. Add dishes to your cart, remove if desired, then click "Order" to checkout. Credit card transactions are handled by Stripe in developer/test mode, so no payment will actually be processed. Use credit card number 4242424242424242 with any 3 digit CVC and any future expiration date for a successful test transaction.
